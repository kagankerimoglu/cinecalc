# CineCalc

Repository of various HTML-based calculators related to cineamatography.

## ⌨️ Calculators

- `Depth of Field Calculator` — Compute depth of field, near/far focus limits, hyperfocal distance, and circle of confusion.
- `Field of View Calculator` — Compute field width, subject distance, or required focal length.
- `Exposure Calculator` — Perform exposure calculations.
- `Log Exposure Calculator` — Compute signal value based on exposure value relative to 0.18 for a given log camera curve.
